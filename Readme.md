### This mod is in an alpha state, and I will be really surprised if nothing breaks while using it, so for the love of the almighty Notch, make backup of your world before using this mod

**More Mounted Storages** mod allows for a greater variety of the modded item storages to be used as a part of Create moving contraptions, as well as providing an API for other mod makers to add their own types of mounted storages.

Currently, only item storages are supported, and fluid storages support won't be added until Create add some form of an API for them

## Currently supported mods:
- [Ender Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ender-storage-1-8): Ender Chest
- [Iron Chests](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-chests): All chest types
- [Storage Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/storage-drawers): Both normal and compacting variants
- [Framed Compacting Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/framed-compacting-drawers): Same as above
- [Immersive Engineering](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering): Crates
- [Industrial Foregoing](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-foregoing): Black Hole Unit and Black Hole Controller (items only)
- [PneumaticCraft: Repressurized](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pneumaticcraft-repressurized'''): Smart chest fix, but this integration requires PnC build 273 or higher, and since the curent public build is 272, this bugfix won't be in play until the next PnC update
